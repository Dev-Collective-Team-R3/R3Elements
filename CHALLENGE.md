# Build your own Bootstrap

Hello, friends! We're going to build our own version of Bootstrap today. I'm your host, Monarch Wadia. I have nearly 10 years of experience as a full stack web developer and have built all the three-letter ~~agencies~~ acronyms: SPAs, PWAs, SDKs, CLIs, APIs, MVCs, and more. Today, we're going to build a CSS framework -- which is actually something that I had never done before building this challenge!

It was really fun putting together today's kanban. I really hope you enjoy yourselves.

Grab your CSS pre-processors and get ready to `#town {color: red}`!

## Step 1 -

## Step 1 - Pick a way to set variables

Setting variables lets you build consistency into your CSS framework. CSS pre-processors provide tools that let you build your stylesheets with ease. I've chosen to use SCSS, but you can use LESS, PostCSS, or anything else. In fact, if you're feeling REALLY modern, you might even forego a preprocessor and just use [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
